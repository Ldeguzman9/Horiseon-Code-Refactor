## Horiseon Code Refactor ##
As web developer we have to be prepared to take on previously written code and find startegic ways to improve their readability. In this project I was given previously written code and given the task of imroving its lifecycle and dryness. 

## Overview

In order to create a webpage that meets accessibility standards:
```
First, I adjusted the source code in order to create semantic HTML elements
Second, I adjusted the order to ensure elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
Third, I added accessible alt attributes
Fourth, I examined the heading attributes find that they fall in sequential order
Finally, I adjusted the title element in order to find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Criteria

User Story
```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our site is optimized for search engines
```
Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards

THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element

```
## Motivation? Why did you build this project? 
This project simulated a real-world problem that I may face as a developer. Sometimes code is written in a lengthy and repertative way and may need to be consolidated for long term sustainability. 

## What problem does it solve? What did you learn? 
![VS Code Screen Shot](https://github.com/Ldeguzman9/Module-1---Challenge/blob/main/Assets/Images/Code%20Screenshot.png?raw=true)
I faced a couple of issues. I learned to double check case sensitivity on images to ensure that they work when a live link is deployed. The new code solves the issue of a complicated code that may be difficult to adjust if a developer would like to make adjustments or add new features to the page.

## What makes your project stand out?
I believe my project is very well organized and easy to read. Any developer could pick it up and know exactly what was done.
